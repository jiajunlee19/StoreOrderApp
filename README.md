# Store Order App

This project is for demo purpose, the system is running under local host environment.

In this project, we will build a 3-tier store order management application.
1. Database: mysql
2. Backend: Python Flask
3. Front end: UI is written in HTML/CSS/Javascript


### Installation Instructions
Download mysql for windows: https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/
`pip install mysql-connector-python`



# Database: mysql

I have generated a CREATE_TABLES.sql script, you can run it in mySQL Workbench and it will create everything required for this project automatically.

[CREATE_TABLE.sql](/Database/CREATE%20TABLES.sql)

To reduce data redundancy, your database structure should at least meeting third normalization level - 3NF
1. 1NF: Each table cell should contain a single value, and each record needs to be unique
2. 2NF: Each table should have a Single Column Primary Key and contains only columns related to the primary key
3. 3NF: Each column of a table should be transitive functional independent to other columns in the table

Each base table contains a UUID primary key column. 
UUID5 is generated by [uuid_generation.py](/Backend/uuid_generation.py)

Here's how the schema diagram looks like:

# Backend: Python Flask
All database-related functions are defined in:
[db_connection.py](Backend/db_connection.py)

Generate a Flask server, keep it running to connect backend to frontend
[server_flask.py](/Frontend/server_flask.py)

   

# Frontend 
Here's the front end, developed using HTML and Javascript with minimum CSS involvement. All pages are having interactive functions to add new item/edit existing item/delete existing item.

1. To add order item, dropdown options are given based on product/uom available.

2. To update order item, primary items are automatically populated into read-only field upon 'edit' button click.

# Idea: Additional Features 
1. Design a login system, giving two type of access level.
   1. User can only manage their order/order_item
   2. Admin have additional privileges to manage member/member_level/uom/product

2. Design a discount system for users with higher member level
   1. Users can get discount % based on their member level
   2. Users can be upgraded into higher member level when bonus points reached certain level

3. Publish website into cloud
